There are [more sophisticated versions of this](https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script) out there, but `adhesive` has some advantages: \n- There is very little configuration, so it won't take you more than a few minutes to get it working. \n- It __outputs source maps__ so you can easily debug the minified version of your code. \n- It's so simple that you can grab the repo and modify it to your heart's content â€“ without spending very long learning how it works.\n\n`adhesive` doesn't bother with css.  I usually have [compass](http://compass-style.org/) watching my scss files and combining them already.\n\n##Installation\n\nYou need to install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.  Then:\n\n`npm install adhesive -g`\n\nOr you can clone this repository, `cd` into into it, and run `npm link`.  That's a good option if you want to try modifying adhesive.\n\n##Usage\n\n`adhesive <config_path> [--debug | --dont-minify | --help]`\n\nYour config file must have a .json extension.  You may omit the extension when invoking adhesive. For example, if your configuration file is named `build.json`, the following are equivalent:\n\n`adhesive build`<br/>\n`adhesive build.json`\n\n###Flags\n\n`--debug`\n- Compiles a source map.\n- Defines a constant DEBUG=true which you can use to hide console.log from the production build. [More info on my blog](http://jstarrdewar.com/blog/2013/02/28/use-uglify-to-automatically-strip-debug-messages-from-your-javascript/).\n\n`--no-uglify`\n- Will tell adhesive to only concatenate your code (no uglifying), which is useful if you need to debug something in a browser that doesn't support source maps.\n\n`--help`\n- Displays this information in the terminal.\n\n###Automation\n\nI recommend using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) with adhesive to recombine your code each time you make a change.  Thanks to source maps, this allows you to have a nice workflow that is pretty much identical to using `<script>` tags:\n\n`npm install nodemon -g`<br/>\n`nodemon adhesive build --debug`\n\n##Configuration\n\nThe configuration file is a JSON document.  It requires that you specify an array of source files and an output path, like so:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sources\":[\n        \"swipe.js\",\n        \"PxLoader.js\",\n        \"PxLoaderImage.js\",\n        \"main.js\"\n    ],\n    \"outputPath\":\"main_built.js\"\n}\n```\nIt probably goes without saying that the sources are concatenated in the order listed, so if your site currently has a list of script tags, you'll want to maintain that same order in here.\n\n###Optional Parameters\nYou can set a `sourceRoot` path that will be prepended to the filenames in the `sources` array:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sourceRoot\":\"js/\",\n    \"sources\":[\n        \"vendor/swipe.js\",\n        \"vendor/PxLoader.js\",\n        \"vendor/PxLoaderImage.js\",\n        \"main.js\"\n    ],\n    \"outputPath\":\"js/main_built.js\"\n}\n```\n###Source Map Options\nThe source map will automatically be saved alongside the built file.  In the previous example if you called `adhesive build.json --debug`, you would get two files saved to your `js` folder:\n\n`main_built.js`<br/>\n`main_built.js.map`\n\nYou can customize this by adding a `sourceMap` object.  It has two parameters: `path` and `root`.  The source map will be saved at `path`, and `root` specifies where the source map will look for files.  This gets a little confusing, because it's relative to the source map's path at runtime.  If you set the source map path to `maps/main_sourcemap.map` and the `root` isn't set to anything, the source map will look for files in `maps/js/`, which is not what you want.  When in doubt, don't set `root`.  It will automatically be pointed to the current folder, which is usually the right choice.\n\nHere's an example configuration with everything in it:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"sourceRoot\":\"js/vendor/\",\n    \"sources\":[\n        \"swipe.js\",\n        \"PxLoader.js\",\n        \"PxLoaderImage.js\"\n    ],\n    \"outputPath\":\"js/built/vendor.js\",\n    \"sourceMap\":{\n        \"path\":\"maps/vendor.js.map\",\n        \"root\":\"../\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##License\nFreeBSD:\n```\nCopyright (c) 2013, John Starr Dewar\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met: \n\n1.
