`adhesive` is a simple build tool that uses UglifyJS to concatenate your JavaScript and make you a nice source map.

I expect this to be most useful for simple, front-end focused projects, particularly those that are already working with a traditional list of `<script>` tags in `index.html` (and where you may not want to rock the boat).  There are [more sophisticated versions of this](https://github.com/h5bp/node-build-script) out there, but `adhesive` has some advantages: 
- There is very little configuration, so it won't take you more than a few minutes to get it working. 
- It __outputs source maps__ so you can easily debug the minified version of your code. 
- It's so simple that you can grab the repo and modify it to your heart's content â€“ without spending very long learning how it works.

`adhesive` doesn't bother with css.  I usually have [compass](http://compass-style.org/) watching my scss files and combining them already.

##Installation

You need to install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.  Then:

`npm install adhesive -g`

Or you can clone this repository, `cd` into into it, and run `npm link`.  That's a good option if you want to try modifying adhesive.

##Usage

`adhesive <config_path> [--debug | --dont-minify | --help]`

Your config file must have a .json extension.  You may omit the extension when invoking adhesive. For example, if your configuration file is named `build.json`, the following are equivalent:

`adhesive build`<br/>
`adhesive build.json`

###Flags

`--debug`
- Compiles a source map.
- Defines a constant DEBUG=true which you can use to hide console.log from the production build. [More info on my blog](http://jstarrdewar.com/blog/2013/02/28/use-uglify-to-automatically-strip-debug-messages-from-your-javascript/).

`--no-uglify`
- Will tell adhesive to only concatenate your code (no uglifying), which is useful if you need to debug something in a browser that doesn't support source maps.

`--help`
- Displays this information in the terminal.

###Automation

I recommend using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) with adhesive to recombine your code each time you make a change.  Thanks to source maps, this allows you to have a nice workflow that is pretty much identical to using `<script>` tags:

`npm install nodemon -g`<br/>
`nodemon adhesive build --debug`

##Configuration

The configuration file is a JSON document.  It requires that you specify an array of source files and an output path, like so:

```json
{
    "sources":[
        "swipe.js",
        "PxLoader.js",
        "PxLoaderImage.js",
        "main.js"
    ],
    "outputPath":"main_built.js"
}
```
It probably goes without saying that the sources are concatenated in the order listed, so if your site currently has a list of script tags, you'll want to maintain that same order in here.

###Optional Parameters
You can set a `sourceRoot` path that will be prepended to the filenames in the `sources` array:

```json
{
    "sourceRoot":"js/",
    "sources":[
        "vendor/swipe.js",
        "vendor/PxLoader.js",
        "vendor/PxLoaderImage.js",
        "main.js"
    ],
    "outputPath":"js/main_built.js"
}
```
###Source Map Options
The source map will automatically be saved alongside the built file.  In the previous example if you called `adhesive build.json --debug`, you would get two files saved to your `js` folder:

`main_built.js`<br/>
`main_built.js.map`

You can customize this by adding a `sourceMap` object.  It has two parameters: `path` and `root`.  The source map will be saved at `path`, and `root` specifies where the source map will look for files.  This gets a little confusing, because it's relative to the source map's path at runtime.  If you set the source map path to `maps/main_sourcemap.map` and the `root` isn't set to anything, the source map will look for files in `maps/js/`, which is not what you want.  When in doubt, don't set `root`.  It will automatically be pointed to the current folder, which is usually the right choice.

Here's an example configuration with everything in it:

```json
{
    "sourceRoot":"js/vendor/",
    "sources":[
        "swipe.js",
        "PxLoader.js",
        "PxLoaderImage.js"
    ],
    "outputPath":"js/built/vendor.js",
    "sourceMap":{
        "path":"maps/vendor.js.map",
        "root":"../"
    }
}
```
